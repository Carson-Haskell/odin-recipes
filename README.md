# The Odin Project Web Development 101
## Project: Recipe Pages

This is one of my first projects through Odin that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub to build a simple website.
Although it is very basic, it is an exercise in building something from the ground up.

I know the website looks horrible. My focus was not on making a pretty website (I'll focus on that later); rather, I wanted to build a simple website structure that was functional.
I implemented some basic styling in the html files but am well aware it is not pretty.
